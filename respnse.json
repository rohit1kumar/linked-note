            "\"Why should I provide support on WhatsApp? It's too expensive.\"This was the biggest hesitation for many business leaders when considering WhatsApp as their main customer support channel. As a result, customers were stuck navigating outdated support through emails and calls.But here's the game-changer: Starting this November, service conversations on WhatsApp will be COMPLETELY free.When given the choice, 80% of customers prefer WhatsApp over emails and calls. This shift opens up incredible opportunities for brands to enhance their CX.With Gen AI-powered solutions on WhatsApp, you can elevate CX and drive down costs at the same time.This is all part of Meta\u2019s broader strategy to position WhatsApp as a channel for meaningful conversations vs spamming users.We\u2019re standing at the forefront of a customer experience revolution.

            "Diwali has been a special tradition for us at LimeChat since we started building our team in 2021. Diwali season is one of the busiest times in e-commerce, and our team works hard from July to October to make sure everything runs smoothly.This year felt extra special. We didn\u2019t just reach our goals\u2014we achieved more than ever before. From record-breaking sales to stronger customer relationships and closer team bonds, 2024 has been our best year yet.Our Diwali party is a time to relax, celebrate our efforts, and enjoy with friends and family before a well-earned break.Wishing everyone a Diwali 2024 filled with happiness and light!",
            "The last step of manual effort in quick commerce is about to be over.Swiggy is set to launch shopping lists!You will be able to upload an image of your shopping list - the app will scan it and show all the items to add to cart. Now I will create a grocery list for Diwali pooja or daily groceries with ChatGPT\u2014and upload it all to Instamart as a screenshot or note.No more manual item-by-item searching; just snap, upload, and shop.This might be big enough to make me switch back from Blinkit to Instamart!",
            "The Bhavish Aggarwal vs. Kunal Kamra clash taught me one big thing.Customer experience can make or break a brand.Ola Electric had arguably one of the best IPOs this year.They listed at a price lower than their valuation and then saw amazing growth in the public markets after listing.This was because they were the market leader in the rapidly growing EV space.But now the focus has shifted away from Ola Electric\u2019s products, profits, and sales to its service. And that has led to a staggering 50% drop in stock price.Here\u2019s the lesson:Your brand cannot be defined by service issues, since the customer narrative isn\u2019t forgiving. Sales can be benchmarked against past performance, but service is held to perfection - even one dissatisfied customer keeps the narrative going.Ola\u2019s story went from \u201cditch your old bike for our sleek, new EV\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019re addressing 99% of reported issues.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful reminder: no matter how innovative the product, CX needs to keep pace.",
